### About
This **Hoverboard App** provides a fun and educational way to explore how CSS hover effects and JavaScript can work together to create dynamic and responsive user interactions. The primary functionality allows users to hover over squares, triggering visual effects such as color changes, gradient transitions, and fading, making it perfect for those looking to understand hover effects or enhance their web design skills.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Users can hover over individual squares on the grid to trigger different effects, such as color changes, glowing borders, and smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Grid Layout:** The app features a flexible grid layout, allowing for various grid sizes and arrangements to create diverse visual patterns.
- **Smooth Transitions:** The app utilizes smooth CSS transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, ensuring each hover effect feels fluid and responsive.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout and hover effects are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience across different screen sizes.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** for structuring the grid layout and defining the interactive elements.
- **CSS3** for implementing hover effects, animations, and smooth transitions that respond to user actions.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Handles dynamic aspects like random color generation, hover effect triggers, and grid size adjustments.
- **Flexbox/Grid Layout:** Ensures that the grid is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, enhancing the visual experience across devices.
